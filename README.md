## 🌙 About the Game

**Inside Jerry** tells the story of a boy trapped in a dream world — a final gift from his creator to protect his fragile mind. 💔

Although Jerry’s body may be alive, his spirit is sealed away by something unknown.
No matter how his form may change, his heart remains asleep within…
